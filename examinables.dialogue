A sleek wall-mounted TV hums softly. The news seems to be on.

A young reporter sits across from a man in a flawless black suit. He look enither young nor old. His face expresionless.

Reporter: So, Mr. Voss, congratulations on securing the new federal contract! With national IDs now under HAVEMORE’s management, some say your company is practically running the country.

CEO Voss: Oh, we don’t run the country.
CEO Voss: We simply maintain it. The country runs through us.
