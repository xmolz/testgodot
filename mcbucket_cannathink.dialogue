An ancient man leans back in his hospital chair. 
The squint in his eyes seems to have relaxed. 
What do you say to him?
~ hub 
- Hey, how are you?
	Old Man McBucket: I...am. Yes.
	- Excuse me?
		Old Man McBucket: I would never accuse you of anything, friend.
		Old Man McBucket: I think you are just...[i] splendid[/i].
		It seems the medicine has taken its effect on the old man. Maybe he won't distrub you and Sergei now.
		Is there anything else you want to say to him?
		=> hub

- Nice eyes, old man.
	Old Man McBucket: Thanks! Got ’em from my sister’s side of the family, I think.
	- Your..sister's side? 
		Hehehe...Yeah. She's got great knees too. That woman. 
		The medicine has certainly had an effect on him, you think. He probably won't disturb you and Sergei now.
		Is there anything else you want to say to him?
		=> hub

- Tell me something about yourself, old man.
	Old Man McBucket: Something about.....me? 
	Old Man McBucket: What d’ya wanna know?
	~ hub2
	- What’s your name?
		Old Man McBucket: Sure! Do you wanna know my [i]worldly[/i] name... or my [i]real[/i] name?

		- Your worldly name.
			Old Man McBucket: That would be... Mr. Turtle.
			- Mr. Turtle?
				Old Man McBucket: Yes. I rarely come outta my shell. And I swim. I always swim.
				- Okay… what’s your real name then?
					=> love

		- Your real name.
			~ love
			Old Man McBucket: That would be... Love.

			- Love? What do you mean?
				Old Man McBucket: I mean the only real thing in this world [i]is[/i] love.
				Old Man McBucket: Say, kid… you ever loved anyone before?

				- Yes.
					Old Man McBucket: Hah! Then you already know what I’m talking about!
					Old Man McBucket: Hold onto it, kid. It’s rarer than a polite seagull.
					Old Man McBucket: And when you find it again… feed it something nice.
					You see the old man drift away into his own thoughts.
					Is there anything else you'd like to say to the old man?
					=> hub2

				- Not really.
					Old Man McBucket: Then I hope it finds you soon! It’s the most wonderful thing.
					Old Man McBucket: Once you’re in love… you see it everywhere.
					Old Man McBucket: In the grass. In the tiles. On the screen. Even in the chips.

					- The chips?
						Old Man McBucket: Yeah. You got any on ya? I’m gettin’ kinda hungry for some reason.
						The old man makes none and all the sense in the world at the same time.

						- Have you ever been in love?
							Old Man McBucket: Who? Me? I am [i]always[/i] in love.
							Old Man McBucket: It’s not possible for me to [i]not[/i] be in it.
							Old Man McBucket: I only forget sometimes.
							Old Man McBucket: Once, I was walking down the street, and this RoboCop comes up to me and says...
							Old Man McBucket: ...
							Old Man McBucket: Wait—what was I talking about?
						- I'd like to ask something else [Back]
							=> hub2
						- Nevermind [Leave].
							=> leave
				- I can't recall. I have no memories.
					Old Man McBucket: Oh boy, no memories huh?
					Old Man McBucket: Who took 'em from ya? Did you check the fridge?
					You are reminded that you are talking to a person high out of their mind.
					Old Man McBucket: Don't worry kiddo. Maybe they are just out for a swim.
					Old Man McBucket: Maybe one day they'll swim right back to ya.
					The old man's words penetrate you deeply.
					Do you [i] want [/i] the memories to swim back to you?
					Why did you overdose yourself into unconsciousness anyway?
					You push away the thought.
					Is there anything else you'd like to say to the old man?

	- How'd you end up here?
		Old Man McBucket: Here?
		Old Man McBucket: Where are we anyway?
		- We're at a hospital?
			Old Man McBucket: A hospital? hahaha. Well I don't know how I ended up here.
			Old Man McBucket: But I can tell ya one thing for sure - they're wasting their time having me here!
			Old Man McBucket: There ain't a damn thing wrong with Ol' McBucket over here.
			Old Man McBucket: Well, except for my severe case of...
			- Of what?
				Old Man McBucket: Eh? What?
				The old man seems to have lost his train of thought.
				Do you want to talk about something else?
				=> hub2
	- I'd like to ask some other questions [Back].
		What do you wanna say to him?
		=> hub
	- Nevermind [Leave]
		=> leave
- Nevermind. [Leave]
