~ start
An ancient man stares at you intently. 
Or at least, you think. The squint makes it hard to tell.
What do you want to say him?
~ hub 
- Hey, how are you?
	The old man is still and silent.
	Then, almost instantly and possibly with intent to deafen, he screams:
	do change_background_sprite("res://Backgrounds/McBucket/default/mcbucket_normal_ree.png")
	Old Man McBucket: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~~~~~!!!
	do change_background_sprite("res://Backgrounds/McBucket/default/mcbucket_normal_base.png")
	Wow, that was quite something. What do you wanna say to him?
	- What?
		do change_background_sprite("res://Backgrounds/McBucket/default/mcbucket_normal_ree.png")
		Old Man McBucket: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~~~~~!!!
		do change_background_sprite("res://Backgrounds/McBucket/default/mcbucket_normal_base.png")
		The old man seems to know only one response.
		What would you like to do?
		- Scream back at him
			That's it. Only one way to tell the bastard who's in charge.
			You put on your work face.
			Suck all the air you can in - into your stomach.
			You're gonna do it. Scream it back at him.
			3...2...1..

			do shake(1, 10)
			Old Man McBucket: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~~~~~!!!
			do change_background_sprite("res://Backgrounds/McBucket/default/mcbucket_normal_base.png")
			You let all that air out.
			Fucker beat you to it, it seems.
